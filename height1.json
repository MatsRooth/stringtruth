Based on the information provided:

    Amy is taller than Sandy
    Zack is taller than Sandy

We can conclude that:

    Amy is taller than Sandy
    Zack is taller than Sandy
    Therefore, Amy is also taller than Zack

So, the relative heights of Amy and Zack are:

    Amy (tallest)
    Zack (shorter than Amy, but taller than Sandy)
    Sandy (shortest)
